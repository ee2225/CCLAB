                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Crystalbite is the only one of its kind. It sadly does not have any family members. However, scientists have been working on its reproduction process.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>On the first look, Crystalbite may not look like a plant, but it is the most useful creature in the ocean that deals with the tons of plastic waste created by human beings. Its body is a combination of eye-catching pretty colors. </p>

                <span class="green">What we know so far about Crystalbite?</span>
                The crystalbite is a crystal shaped venus flytrap that lives in the ocean and eats plastic waste for living. To protect itself from predators in the ocean, such as sharks, its movement becomes faster and sharper.
                <br>
                <span class="green">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> As humans throw their plastic waste into the ocean, it will drop all the way to the oceanbed and gets eaten by the crystalbite. However, remember you can not touch it, if you do, your arm would be cut off immediately, due to its sharp crystal teeth.
